Ubuntu SSH Remote
=================

To use this application, edit applet.py to contain your ssh connection variables and your commands you wish to run.
Once done, run the applet and you will be able to select your command tite from the menu and it will execute the command over ssh.

I have also included a banshee control over ssh script by JamesIsIn from JamesIsIn.com which is what I built this app around. You can place this script on the remote computer in ~/scripts/bs and then you will be able to use this applet almost out of the box (just add your connection info).
